Changes in version 2024.1.24

- update NEWS and Rd files for CRAN.

Changes in version 2020.4.1

- qinwf/re2r URL in DESCRIPTION.

Changes in version 2020.3.30

- reformat DESCRIPTION for CRAN (URL for R Journal paper).

Changes in version 2020.3.25

- test_engines uses available engines.
- bugfix in engine docs: namedCapture.engine is the option name.

Changes in version 2020.3.2

- Use stringsAsFactors=TRUE in test-CRAN-df.

Changes in version 2019.8.7

- str_match_variable(nomatch.error=TRUE) means to stop with an error if any subjects do not match -- error message shows pattern and subjects which do not match. This is fully backwards compatible since arguments with names that contain dots resulted in an error (group names can not contain dots).
- cbind in for loop used in df_match_variable for speed.
- tried parallelizing df_match_variable over subject columns using future, but no significant speedups.
- tried re2_match(parallel=TRUE) but no significant speedups.
- show generated pattern in stop_for_names.
- document/export variable_args_list for viewing generated pattern.
- bugfix for df_match_variable with only one group = name.

Changes in version 2019.7.30

- namedCapture.engine() only used for getting, not setting, option.
- Better examples for *_variable.
- New vignette names.
- Links in docs.

Changes in version 2019.02.28

- new verbose syntax comparison vignette with PCRE_EXTENDED (?x)
- df syntax comparison vignette.

Changes in version 2019.02.25

- vignette typo fixes.

Changes in version 2019.02.21

- Suggest re2r, namedCapture.engine()

Changes in version 2019.01.14

- un-named list interpreted as non-capturing group.
- vignettes.

Changes in version 2019.01.09

- nested capture groups syntax in *_variable using named list.
- inst/extdata/trackDb.txt.gz

Changes in version 2018.11.23

- remove subject arg from df_match_variable in order to support column named "subject"

Changes in version 2015.10.20

- str_match_named was sometimes incorrectly issuing a warning when given NA subjects, but this is now fixed.
- When type.list is supplied, data.frame(stringsAsFactors=FALSE) is now used to create the data.frame from the character match groups matrix. This allows simple numerical conversions using functions like as.numeric and as.integer (before, we got unexpected results since those functions take the factor ID number).

Changes in version 2015.10.15

- Test optional groups, set NA before calling substring to avoid "NAs introduced by coercion" warning.

Changes in version 2015.10.07

- stop with informative errors for pathological subjects and patterns.

Changes in version 2015.10.05

- first version forked from str_match*perl in my .Rprofile. There are several differences:
- the "name" group is used for rownames,
- the entire match is not returned (only the groups),
- str_match_named is vectorized (str_match_perl was not),
- names are taken from subject if present.
