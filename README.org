DEPRECATED: An R package for named capture regular expressions

For named capture regex in R, please use [[https://github.com/tdhock/nc][nc]], which provides functions
similar to =namedCapture::*_variable= but with additional support
for the ICU regex engine.

** Related work
See my [[https://github.com/tdhock/namedCapture-article][journal paper about namedCapture]] for a detailed discussion of R
regex packages. 
- [[https://github.com/tdhock/revector][revector]] provides fast C code for a *vector* of named capture
  regular expressions (namedCapture and base R and only provide
  functions for a single regular expression).
